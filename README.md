The Forest Fire model, a grid-based simulation utilising Von Neumann neighbourhoods, was implemented to study how a fire spreads in a forest. The model examines how the probability p of tree occupancy and grid size N influence fire propagation, convergence behaviour, and computational performance. Using C++ and MPI parallelisation, simulations were conducted across varying grid sizes. Convergence analysis revealed that averaging over M = 50 runs stabilises results, particularly near the critical probability p = 0.6, where percolation-like transitions enable the fire to reach the bottom of the grid. Performance studies dug into the relationship between MPI task allocation and the size of the grid. Smaller grids showed to suffer from communication overhead, while larger grids efficiently utilise up to 28 MPI tasks. This highlights the balance between computational cost and accuracy, confirming that optimal MPI task distribution depends on the grid size.
